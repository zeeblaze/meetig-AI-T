# Meetig-AI-T
Official repository of Meetig-AI-T.

## Yolo
To use the yolo you have to download the 32bit Yolov8n from [Ultralytics github](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) and convert it to onnx and put it in the "models" folder not "quantized-models". But all other models in the repository are 16bit.

## 16bit
To use all 16bit both Yolo and all anime gan, switch to the "meetigait-v2.0" branch of this repository.
